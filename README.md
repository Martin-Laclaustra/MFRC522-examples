This repository contains examples of complex uses of the Arduino MFRC522 library in https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid.

List of examples:
- UIDRemovalDetection: I could not find an appropriate example for detecting card removal. Good efforts were attempted in https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid/issues/188 and https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid/issues/352 but all were quite hacky. The best implementation was that in https://github.com/TheNitek/RfidShelf . A concise example was lacking.
